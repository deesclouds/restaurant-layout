Restaurant

<div align="center">

This project was built as a template for restaurants that need a website built.

<p align="center"><img src="images/restaurant-layout.gif" alt="gif of restaurant site"></p>

It uses placeholder images to generate random images within the pizza category.

**How It's Made:**

Tech used: HTML, CSS, CSS Grid by utilizing (https://angrytools.com/css-grid/), Flexbox, placeholder images were used via VS Code extension from (https://lorem.space), icons used from (https://fontawesome.com), (https://logodust.com), and placeholder logo from (https://logoipsum.com/).

**Optimizations:**

I am still working on the responsiveness of this project and will need to refractor the CSS code to be clear. So far I've formatted the code by using Prettier for ease of reading.

**Lessons Learned:**

Got this idea from the 100Devs to build a [restaurant template](https://communitytaught.org/img/resources/restaurant.png) to help those struggling during the pandemic thrive and gain a larger audience by helping improve their web presence.

**Thank You!**

Thank you Leon Noel providing free education online and the 100Devs community for being awesome so awesome and uplifting.
